# Board Game Resume Project Ish

Copy and paste comments from other files here.  Remember to do again at end of project.

## locationData

Object keys are snake_case instead of camelCase, for integration with SQL database.
(It is assumed SQL database will not have case sensitivity on.)

locationData contains data specific to locations, but generally not data that could be expressed
at a higher level of abstraction.
E.g. Algorithm Alley is not shown here to be in group "a"; that is tracked at another level.
If a player owns all skills in the "a" group, cost to other players doubling is not shown here.

When actions are taken in other parts of the game, data in locationData may be updated.
E.g. a player buys a property in group "a"; as part of that process the game checks if all other
group "a" properties are owned by the same player, and if so upgrades "synergy".  When a property
in group "a" is sold, "synergy" is downgraded if appropriate.

Similarly, when a proficiency investment is attempted, a check is made to see if the appropriate 
property has sufficient synergy.  If so, and other conditions met (like cost paid and no auction)
then "proficiency_level" is upgraded.

## Later Sturcture Notes

Adding another board game setup requires addition to database and/or state switch.  That's . . . well.
Remember, add history and game record and commentary.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
